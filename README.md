# Ethical-Executive-Function-Architecture

KOAN AI — Ethical Executive Function Interface  
Summary  KOAN AI is a single-screen deliberative interface for an Ethical Executive Function AI system designed for TEMPO Labs.
It visualizes the AI's internal reasoning process as it moves through seven executive states (S0–S7), surfacing ethical tensions, 
epistemic uncertainties, and decision points. The user is positioned as the ultimate authority, with the AI serving as a reflective 
assistant that illuminates rather than dictates.
Design Archetype
HUD / Glassmorphism with Philosophical Brutalism
This archetype merges the technical precision of a heads-up display (dark mode, translucent layers, glowing accents) with the raw, 
uncompromising clarity of brutalist design (thick borders, high contrast, unapologetic hierarchy). The result is a UI that feels both 
futuristic and deeply serious — a tool for ethical deliberation, not casual conversation.
Key Components
State Visualizer: A vertical or radial diagram showing the seven executive states (S0–S7) with the current active state highlighted. 
States pulse or glow subtly to indicate processing.
Core Module Cards: Five translucent cards representing SCA, CEA, EEA, SARA, and NSA. Each card displays its current status (active, 
complete, suspended) and key insights in real-time.
Tension Indicator: A visual meter or alert system that surfaces ethical conflicts, epistemic gaps, or risk flags. Uses amber/red glows for urgency.
Synthesis Output Panel: A structured text area displaying the six-part response format (Synthesis, Recommendation, Risks, Uncertainties, 
Human Review Points, Limits Note). Styled as a terminal or code block for clarity.
Human Override Controls: Prominent buttons for "Suspend" (SX) and "Request Human Review" (SH). These are always visible and never disabled.
Longitudinal Coherence Timeline: A subtle horizontal timeline showing past decisions or reasoning chains (MAC), allowing users to audit consistency over time.

Core Interactions
Query Submission: User enters a prompt or ethical dilemma. The system begins processing through S0–S7, with each state lighting up sequentially.
State Inspection: User can click on any active state (e.g., CEA or ITA) to expand a detailed view of that module's reasoning, tensions, or flags.
Tension Drill-Down: When the Tension Indicator glows, user can click to see a breakdown of conflicting values, missing evidence, or risk factors.
Manual Suspension: User can halt processing at any point using the Suspend button, triggering SX and freezing the current state.
Human Review Request: If the system detects high-stakes conditions, it auto-triggers SH and prompts the user to make the final call.
Output Review: Once S7 is reached, the Synthesis Output Panel reveals the six-part structured response. User can accept, revise, or reject.
Timeline Navigation: User can scroll through the Longitudinal Coherence Timeline to compare current reasoning with past sessions.





Design Principle: This interface is not conversational — it is deliberative. Every element reinforces the gravity of ethical reasoning. The user must feel like they are operating a precision instrument, not chatting with a bot.
